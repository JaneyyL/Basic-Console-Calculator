# Basic Console Calculator

I'm recently new to C++, this project is sort of an "overall review" for me to impliment what i learn into a practical application.
This project will be updated fairly often as I progress through my C++ learning. Comments, advice, and critisism welcome though,
keep in mind as of uploading this source code i've only been learning for a total of two days. Enjoy :)

## Future plans with this application

1. Convert numbers to the power of (Currently being worked on)
2. I want this to be capable of solving basic math as well as simple algebra
3. More efficient and readable code
